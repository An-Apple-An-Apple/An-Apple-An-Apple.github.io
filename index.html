                    Computer graphics is what people see, whether that be on phones, computers, or tablets. Computer
                    graphics define the
                    colors of each pixel on the screen. It defines how people interact with computers and what they
                    show. Without its
                    concepts, humans can not use computers and get visual results. YOU can not see this information. YOU
                    will not see any
                    screen. There will be no video games, no phones, no computers, no tablets. There will be no
                    simulation in this world,
                    and no prediction of the future; no weather app, no tide warnings, no safe experiments.

                    even more complicated; stack upon
                    stacks of paper made
                    by hand. As technology develops computers will be more powerful and alongside computer graphics. AI
                    based simulation
                    could be real time or even faster than reality. Computers can create an alternate reality where we
                    can simulate
                    everything, know everything ahead of time. Disasters can be prevented and lives can be saved and
                    improved. Computer
                    graphics is the user interface of a computer, and the mouth of hands of a digital creature.

                    Computer simulation is predictions. Based on real-world examples in the past, simulators calculate
                    the
                    future. Some
                    real-world examples have been categorized into laws, such as those of aerodynamic, and heat
                    transfer.
                    Those laws enable
                    simulation to be more powerful and accurate than ever before. It can now predict weather events,
                    aircraft trajectory,
                    and even human brains and thoughts. Those predictions allow humans to know the outcome of events
                    before
                    their arrival,
                    so we can prepare and avoid catastrophes. Humans can simulate little blobs of fluids in order to
                    predict
                    weather. <br><br>
                    Simulate how rays of particles zooming into and out of existence inside a computer inorder to
                    simulate
                    light and make
                    digital images look photorealistic. We can simulate how a rock would break to know what that rock
                    looked
                    like 1 million
                    years ago. To copy nature is to simulate the future. Simulations can predict how things would go in
                    the
                    future, but also
                    the past. Simulation is a time machine. We can travel forward and backward. With enough calculation
                    powers, we can
                    simulate everything.

                    Through this project, I have learned much about web development. It has mastered me in javascript,
                    css, and git of which
                    I have never touched before. But more, the amount of effort starting from v1.0 which looks
                    horrendous and is
                    uninteractive and unresponsive until the at least minimalist v3.0 has shown me that with discipline,
                    I can do anything
                    even if I start from the beginning as long as I take the first step. It does not matter how
                    complicated your goals are,
                    you have to set high standards. <br><br> It is impossible to make perfection on the first try but
                    you can
                    slowly build on it. If
                    you set low standards, it is hard to create interests and find motivation. I have found through this
                    project that I am
                    extremely practical and learn best from actions although with strict explanations and
                    documentations. In this project, I
                    have learned that it is always hard for me to find reasons and motivation to start actions and thus
                    I frequently do not,
                    however I have learned that once I do, I can create as many fantastic creations as I want.
